# Rebound

Mobile game I have made using unity. It involves drawing lines that a ball 'rebounds' off of to hit a static centre ball to score points.
Modifiers are made available as you achieve higher and higher scores. I have made sure that the game itself is as close to being as uncheesable as possible.
